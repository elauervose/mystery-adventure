Knowledge lies before you, while ignorance lies behind,
Two of us will help you, whichever you would find,

One among us seven will let you move ahead,
Another will transport the wearer back instead,

Two among our number are purely for design,
Three of us are cursed, waiting hidden in line.

Choose, unless you wish to stay here for evermore,
To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:

First, however slyly the cursed spectacles try to hide
You will always find some on designâ€™s left side;

Second, different are those who stand at either end,
But if you would move onwards, neither is your friend;

Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
Neither dwarf nor giant bears death as their wearer's prize;

Fourth, the second left and the second on the right
Are twins once you wear them, though different at first sight.










Since the giant bottle is not poison and it is a twin to the second from the left, we know these two are nettle wine (2nd and 6th).
Therefore two of the poisons are to the left of these (1st and 5th).
The ones at each end are different and since we know the left end is poison, both nettle wines have been found, and it will not help you move onwards, the rightmost bottle sends you back (7th).
This leaves 2 bottles and we know the dwarf is not poison, so it must be the one to move ahead (3rd).
Finally, the remaining bottle must be the third poison (4th).


one(cursed) - two(design) - three(tiny, move ahead) - four(cursed) - five(cursed) - six(large design) - seven(send you back)
