            Unicorn trainers also read these magnificent, mythological creatures bedtime stories at night and brushing the Unicorn twenty seven times a day. Strictly speaking, the crucial part is keeping the Unicorn happy and making sure it doesn't run out of dental floss. Unicorn trainers remain today, as in ancient times, elusive, moving among us largely unknown. Unknown but for one man.

          The Vose Way: How to Capture a Unicorn, a Step-By-Step Guide: The Can't-Fail, Step-by-Step Instructions To Capturing (and Releasing) A Unicorn

          1.
          The first task for the would-be hunter is to gather a party of quick, strong people; they must all be able to remain calm under pressure and summon bravery in the face of the unknown. No harm will come to travelers in a unicorn's city, but to most people, the vision of the unicorn is unnerving in its beauty and splendor, and the ability to keep a clear mind and steady hand will prove invaluable to this mission.

          As it can take up to two weeks to capture a unicorn, the next priority is packing the proper provisions to prepare for a long, hard wait in the darkest depths of the city. It is suggested that the group bring lots of natural foods; fruits, vegetables, and nuts are best, but probably will not last the entire two weeks, so bread is essential as well. It is important to ensure that nothing that was begotten from the bodies of other animals is brought along - no eggs or milk, and especially no meat of any kind. Unicorns cannot abide the existence of butchers within its domain.

          The hunter should also pack a significant amount of rope, several bottles of bubbles and bubble blowing wands, and a butterfly net with which to attract and temporarily capture the creature. Finally, a virgin must accompany the people on this quest. The only hope of capturing a unicorn rests on this virgin, as unicorns will only approach pure and beautiful young people. If, for some reason a virgin cannot be found (we realize that such a problem may be shocking to you but  we have heard some areas of the world do occasionally encounter such problems and want to account for these things as much as possible), you can substitute a virgin for the biggest slut in your party of gathered people. How you decide this is up to your group  - we just aren't going to micro-manage that for you. Once the provisions have been gathered, it is time to venture forth into the woods to begin the search for the elusive unicorn.

          2.
          Secondly, everyone in the party should keep their eyes open for fountains that are unnaturally clear and free of insects or dirt. A member of the group must taste the water of these fountains; if it is determined to be cooler, sweeter, and more refreshing by far than any other water they have ever swallowed, it means that a unicorn has recently purified that fountain and is more likely than not still close by. The clearer and sweeter the water of the fountain, the closer the unicorn.

          There is usually only one unicorn per forest, and it can be immensely difficult to track, but knowing the signs of a unicorn's passing will aid in the search. When entering the trees, the group should begin the hunt by looking for spots of flowers that follow a more or less linear pattern; blossoms spring from the ground on which a unicorn's cloven hooves have stepped, and there should be a clear path of flowers on the forest floor that indicates where they have recently been.

          The blossoms of these flowers will be full, their stems will be thick, and they will look and smell so alive as to make one think that they would refuse to die even when confronted with the deadly breath of the winter frost.
          It is important to keep in mind, however, that as plain as this trail of blossoms will appear, and as tempting as it will be to follow, the party must not attempt to pursue the unicorn over this floral path, for the unicorn's incredible swiftness makes any attempts by human beings to follow it entirely fruitless.

          3.
          A final key to finding the unicorn is to look and listen for those places in which the animals of the city are in highest volumes, both in numbers and in noise, as they flock to the unicorn for protection and for the pure sense of joy in life they get when around him. Birds will seem to crowd the fountains and parks as much as do the squirrels who will seem to fur the trunks of the trees as they scurry constantly up and down; it will be quite clear that the crowding of critters in the area is unnatural, and thus magically influenced.
          When the searches for flowers, water, and animals are combined, the location of the beast should be relatively easy to discover. After the unicorn's proximity has been determined, find a clearing nearby. Once the clearing has been chosen, the next task is to set up the trap and wait for the beast to approach.

          4.
          The virgin/slut must first be settled into the middle of the clearing. Flowers should then be woven into the hair, as the unicorn will be attracted to them. The virgin/slut should thirdly be instructed to continuously sing or play softly on a sweet-sounding stringed instrument, preferably a small harp, the sound of which will draw the unicorn out of hiding.

          Once the virgin/slut is settled, the people of the hunting party must remain completely out of sight of the clearing, for if the unicorn sees them, it will bolt and never again return to that spot. While waiting, all may eat, drink, and rest as quietly as possible. No one must light a fire; the glow and the smoke will alert the unicorn to the presence of humans, and it will be sure to avoid the clearing.

          Those of the party should slumber as little as possible so as not to miss the unicorn's appearance. When sleep cannot be avoided, turns must be taken to keep watch. When the animal finally steps into the clearing, it is time to ready the group for the capture.

          The unicorn will always approach slowly, cautiously; its appearance is marked first by a strong smell of lavender, followed by a bursting of beautiful song from every bird in every tree in the area and a vibrating hum that fills the air.

          The unicorn will draw near the virgin/slut with elegance and grace before stopping to kneel and lay its head in the virgin's lap. The people must wait a few minutes to allow the virgin/slut's continued melody (the virgin/slut must never stop singing or playing) to lull the animal into a false sense of security. At this point, you will need to employ the bubbles.

          5.
          The bubbles will distract and entice the Unicorn with their iridescent shimmer and light floating about. You will need to completely surround the Unicorn with bubbles until it is entirely disoriented. At this point, you should be able to sweep your butterfly net over it's head and tie a rope around it's neck. Once captured, the unicorn will be calm and curious about it's captors nuzzling and butting them with its nose.  You will need to be careful not to hold the unicorn for too long. 10-15 minutes is the maximum recommended amount of time. Any longer and you may find it hard to release your unicorn and then must suffer the curse.

          This method of catching a unicorn is sure to bring success.

              Unicorn trainers are highly qualified professionals who stand between us and anarchy. Mythically they feed the Unicorns under their responsibility with fairy dust and carrots. The Unicorn diet needs to be perfectly balanced between those two foods because the slightest transgression, one carrot too many for example, can cause the Unicorn to pack up his bags, return to Never, Neverland and sue the particular Unicorn trainer into the poor house.
