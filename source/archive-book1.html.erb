            Introduction
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: .9em;">
            Many are familiar with the Unicorn Guild, Portland Chapter and with the mysterious scandal of 2005 which lead to the disappearance of Guild Members and Unicorn Hunters from mainstream society.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: .9em;">
            But few know the details surrounding this event and the impact is had on Unicorn Culture. This book chronicles the events leading up to and following the scandal and attempts to dispel the fog of mistrust and restore the reputation of the Unicorn Guild and it's members in the public eye.

            Any resemblance to persons living or dead should be plainly apparent to them and those who know them, especially if the author has been kind enough to have provided their real names and, in some cases, their phone numbers.

          <p style="font-size: .6em; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2em; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
            All events described herein actually happened, though on occasion the author has taken certain, very small, liberties with chronology, because that is her right as an American.

            Fact:

          <p>
            Prior to 2005, Chuck Vose was a powerful and influential member of the Unicorn Guild.

          </p>
          <p>
            Marc Charbonneau, less well known, though equally powerful and influential Guild Member and Unicorn Hunter, was Chuck Vose's close associate and long-time friend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marc Charbonneau, and Chuck Vose often led high-profile Unicorn Expeditions together in remote regions of unicorn territory all over the world.

            Fact:
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a significant amount of public controversy leading up to this scandal surrounding the actual methods used by Unicorn Hunters, especially with regard to whether the term "hunter" actually meant killing unicorns.  However, many maintain that it is simply a term used to mean "find" or "track" unicorns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Increased public scrutiny led to a number of other controversial discoveries including the use of "sluts" as "unicorn bait" to attract unicorns rather than "virgins".
          </p>
          <p>
            Although shock over this revelation has mostly died down, many still regard this unconventional approach as morally reprehensible.

            Following the events of 2005, both Chuck Vose and Marc Charbonneau disappeared from the unicorn scene for several years.

            Fact:

          <p>
            Chuck Vose resurfaced in 2010 for a very public return to Unicorn Tracking. However, Marc Charbonneau has remained elusive, his whereabouts unknown until recently when investigators caught up with Marc Charbonneau early this year in Wales and learned more about his life since 2005.

            Impact Assessment:
          </p>
          <p >
            This public review of Guild activity further called into question whether the Guild has been diligent in fulfilling it's regulatory duties to protect mythical creatures, namely; unicorns.
          </p>
          <p>
            The guild has relied on it's aura of mystery and wonder to command respect and maintain its highly influential status in Portland. This embarrassment resulted in a dramatic loss of trust and status for the Guild and all it's members.

          <p >
            Although the Guild has done a great deal to move on from this scandal and re-establish its former glory, some of the Guild's efforts were viewed as an attempt to further obscure the truth from the public. This resulted in backlash from several grassroots organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most vehement among them is the "Unicorn Defense League" an activist group whose tactics have been criticized by many as being too extreme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some worry that as tensions mount, conflict will continue to escalate.

            The Involvement of Consenting Adults is NOT Exploitation
          </p>
          <p>
             What you read was old literature. Times change and our literature changes with us. Those instructions were from a text I wrote over 200 years ago when virgins were plentiful and people were a lot tougher.
          </p>
          <p>
             When that text was written, getting shot in the shoulder was no big deal, it happened all the time.  Additionally, we have a lot more sluts now and they attract Unicorns even better.

        <div class="padded-content bkfnt">
          <p>
             It's a puritanical lie that Unicorns are only drawn to virgins - they actually prefer sluts.
          </p>
          <p>
             Furthermore, with better technology, greater understanding of the psychic plane and the ability to speak with the spirits at the burial grounds,  we no longer need to shoot the virgin in the shoulder with an arrow.... or at all.  A simple combination of non-violent methods render much more efficient and socially acceptable results.
          </p>
          <p>
            The excursion planned for November 20th  is purely non-violent. No virgins or sluts will be injured or exploited in any way whatsoever. All of the participants in my expedition are adults. Consenting adults. And I hold that consent is not exploitation.

            Regarding the reference to the events of 2005; There were extenuating circumstances that were not explained at all in what you read.  We were under a lot of pressure to find unicorns and Portland is notoriously short on virgins ... who are also of legal age to consent to participating in expeditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We made the best decisions we could at the time. Those who weren't there shouldn't judge us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone who doubts my methods or my integrity as a Unicorn Trainer is welcome to join the viewing portion of my expedition to see first hand how I operate.  There really is no better way to understand the majesty of the handsomest of equine nor the purity of my methods.

            Unicorn trainers also read these magnificent, mythological creatures bedtime stories at night and brushing the Unicorn twenty seven times a day. Strictly speaking, the crucial part is keeping the Unicorn happy and making sure it doesn't run out of dental floss. Unicorn trainers remain today, as in ancient times, elusive, moving among us largely unknown. Unknown but for one man.

              He shared with us some insights about Unicorns, Portland and most   importantly,  his expedition scheduled for later this month. Mr. Vose,  do you believe there  really are unicorns in Portland still?

            <blockquote>
              "I think that Portland has a strong history of Unicorns but I donâ€™t   think   they've been seen in a little while. Outside of, obviously  unicorn trainers   and the occasional ethereal vestige in the cloud  form that we've all seen."

              Unicorn Guild Financial Report Summary
            </p>
            <p>
              <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              For centuries, the City of London; Portland Chapter of the Unicorn Guild (also known as "Livery Company" in London) had been piling up fortunes in secret.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              They are some of the most powerful organizations in the City of London,and in Portland controlling billions in assets. Their members dress up in medieval steampunk costumes at every opportunity and are loyal custodians of traditions and ceremonial practices laid down more than 600 years ago.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              But the wealth and influence of the City of London's ancient livery companies and Portland's own Unicorn Guild are almost totally unknown to the uninitiated. Most operate from low-key guild halls in the Square Mile and their membership lists are often closely guarded secrets.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              But in 2005, the foremost livery company, The Unicorn Guild was called upon to  break with tradition and publish an annual review of its activities.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              It made for startling reading. The accounts show that at the end of December 2005, the company had Â£454.6m of assets under management, a rise of Â£42m on the year before. Out of that total, Â£315.6m was in property and other fixed assets, including an extensive residential portfolio in Covent Garden and the Royal Exchange complex, the grandest shopping arcade in the City.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              The Guild, it was revealed had Â£78.5m in quoted assets, up from Â£66.5m in the previous year. If the Guild were a quoted investment trust, it would rank as one of the largest in the UK.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div> <!-- Page 2 - Book 1 "Detailed Account of Unicorn Guild Financial Report-2" -->
          <div class="padded-content bkfnt">
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              The clerk at the Unicorn Guild, who asked to remain anonymous, says: "It is fair to say that people were fairly staggered by the scale of Guild's assets when they were published."
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              Although no figures exist, it is estimated that total assets held by the Unicorn Guild along with the other 107 Livery Companies could total Â£2bn.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              Those involved with livery companies believe that after the Unicorn Guild, the Cloth Workers, Grocers, Drapers, Fishmongers, Goldsmiths and Leather-sellers are the richest, although no one knows which has the most assets.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              And Companies are full of distinguished names from the City. Lord George of St Tudy, the former governor of the Bank of England, and Sir Brian Pitman, the former chairman of Lloyds TSB, are both court members at the Company of International Bankers.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              The Unicorn Guild was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1394. A Guild Member was by definition was a trainer of Unicorns, although the last time a trainer was admitted as an apprentice to the Guild was 1888.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              Like other Livery Companies, the Unicorn Guild derives its 12th and 13th-century origins from a secret society that sprang up around unicorn sightings.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              These fraternities then became powerful trading guilds that often enjoyed monopolistic rights over a particular commodity, such as fish, while remaining true to their mystical origins by seeking out realted mythical creatures.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              From 1560 onwards a guild secured its livery status from the Court of Aldermen who had to be satisfied that "a number of men of good repute from some trade or mystery not already represented by an existing guild have joined together for a time sufficiently long to justify the belief that they will continue to hold together and are not likely to fall apart from lack of interest or support".
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div> <!-- Page 2 - Book 1 "Detailed Account of Unicorn Guild Financial Report-3" -->
          <div class="padded-content bkfnt">
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              Guilds (or Livery Companies) are governed by a master, a number of wardens and a court of assistants, which elects the master and wardens. The chief executive officer of the company is known as the clerk.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              And several modern phrases have their origins in the history of livery Companies. For example, the expression "at sixes and sevens" comes from a medieval dispute over precedence in order of receiving livery status from the City of London between the Merchant Taylors and the Skinners. The 16th-century Lord Mayor of the day decided that the two would be ranked six and seven in alternate years as a way of resolving the argument.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              And the expression "a baker's dozen" to mean 13, originated in the days when the Bakers' guild strictly monitored the standard of bread.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              From the time they were founded until the present day, livery companies have secured funding from rich benefactors, often in the form of property, and the complex interest on their assets over the space of 600 years has created some exceedingly wealthy organizations.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              The Unicorn Guild and a few of the livery Companies still have regulatory duties. The Fishmongers, for example, still monitor standards of hygiene at Billingsgate fish market while the Goldsmiths still check coins issued by the Royal Mint.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              Meanwhile the Vintners and Dyers annually get decked out in ceremonial garb and take a row boat up the Thames to count the number of swans â€“ a practice known as "swan-upping".
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              The Unicorn Guild is charged with the keeping and protection of all mythical creatures and in particular the unicorns.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div> <!-- Page 2 - Book 1 "Detailed Account of Unicorn Guild Financial Report-4" -->
          <div class="padded-content bkfnt">
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              The livery companies also approve the preferred candidates to become Lord Mayor of London.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              As livery companies are founded by royal charter, they are under no obligation to file any records at Companies House. They are only accountable to their membership and the ways in which they spend their millions is totally discretionary. The power of the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog, does not extend to candle-lit Company dining halls.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              Although the Unicorn Guild was publicly pressured into publishing a detailed breakdown of its activities, other companies such as the Mercers have voluntarily opted to follow suit. This is further evidence that the livery companies are adopting a more modern and transparent approach when it comes to their financial activity.
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              Keith Waters, clerk at the Company of Fishmongers, says: "The change is coming from the members themselves. Accountability is something we now all face in our working lives."
            </p>
            <p class="bkfnt-tiny">
              He adds: "Simply put, what was acceptable before, is less acceptable now. The livery companies have been here for centuries. They are nothing less than part of the fabric which underpins the City of London and Portland."
            </p>
