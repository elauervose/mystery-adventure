            Unicorn trainers also read these magnificent, mythological creatures bedtime stories at night and brushing the Unicorn twenty seven times a day. Strictly speaking, the crucial part is keeping the Unicorn happy and making sure it doesn't run out of dental floss. Unicorn trainers remain today, as in ancient times, elusive, moving among us largely unknown. Unknown but for one man.

            November 1770, Chuck Vose returned to the source. This was an epic moment in Unicorn history when Chuck Vose proved that Unicorns still exist in Portland. Together with is crew, and his assistant, Teiden, Chuck Vose changed the course of modern unicorn history.

        <blockquote>
          "I think that Portland has a strong history of Unicorns but I don’t   think   they've been seen in a little while. Outside of, obviously  unicorn trainers   and the occasional ethereal vestige in the cloud  form that we've all seen."

              Unicorn trainers are highly qualified professionals who stand between us and anarchy. Mythically they feed the Unicorns under their responsibility with fairy dust and carrots. The Unicorn diet needs to be perfectly balanced between those two foods because the slightest transgression, one carrot too many for example, can cause the Unicorn to pack up his bags, return to Never, Neverland and sue the particular Unicorn trainer into the poor house.
