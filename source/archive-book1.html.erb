            "I think that Portland has a strong history of Unicorns but I don’t   think   they've been seen in a little while. Outside of, obviously  unicorn trainers   and the occasional ethereal vestige in the cloud  form that we've all seen."

            Is Chuck Vose using virgins and sluts as Unicorn Bait in pursuit of his own twisted agenda?  Do we really want a man who exploits virgins and sluts indiscriminately as a role model for our communities' young people?

            The Involvement of Consenting Adults is NOT Exploitation
          </p>
          <p>
             What you read was old literature. Times change and our literature changes with us. Those instructions were from a text I wrote over 200 years ago when virgins were plentiful and people were a lot tougher.
          </p>
          <p>
             When that text was written, getting shot in the shoulder was no big deal, it happened all the time.  Additionally, we have a lot more sluts now and they attract Unicorns even better.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div><!-- Page 16 -Book 1 -->
        <div class="padded-content bkfnt">
          <p>
             It's a puritanical lie that Unicorns are only drawn to virgins - they actually prefer sluts.
          </p>
          <p>
             Furthermore, with better technology, greater understanding of the psychic plane and the ability to speak with the spirits at the burial grounds,  we no longer need to shoot the virgin in the shoulder with an arrow.... or at all.  A simple combination of non-violent methods render much more efficient and socially acceptable results.
          </p>
          <p>
            The excursion planned for November 20th  is purely non-violent. No virgins or sluts will be injured or exploited in any way whatsoever. All of the participants in my expedition are adults. Consenting adults. And I hold that consent is not exploitation.

We were under a lot of pressure to find unicorns and Portland is notoriously short on virgins ... who are also of legal age to consent to participating in expeditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We made the best decisions we could at the time. Those who weren't there shouldn't judge us.
