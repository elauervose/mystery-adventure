Is Chuck Vose, World Famous Unicorn Tamer, Exploiting Sluts and Vigins?

This exclusive expose just released;  The Vose Unicorn Way; how to lure a Unicorn.

Is Chuck Vose using virgins and sluts as Unicorn Bait in pursuit of his own twisted agenda?  Do we really want a man who exploits virgins and sluts indiscriminately as a role model for our communities' young people?
Allegations abound that Vose is using his skill for the black market sale of Unicorn Horn. Has he been dabbling in the illegal use of Horn in healing potions and other cures?

Certainly, he denies all accusations but we have to wonder, he does seem overly preoccupied with the healing benefits and merits of the magical and magnificent Unicorn Horn.  And did he really mean to write lure instead of capture? Is all this a matter of a single typo?  Or is it something much darker? Have we misplaced our faith in this new genre folk hero?
You be the judge.

Here below, for the first time ever, available for public scrutiny is no less than the actual methods used by Chuck Vose himself to lure and train Unicorns.

This information combined with the tragic events of 2005, we have to wonder if Chuck Vose has something to prove? Is he truly recovered from his dark past or has he he gotten back into his old reckless ways?

Though he would like us to believe that is all past and gone,  is this just a new iteration of last time where we watch as he uses people recklessly?
Is he bound for more disaster?

The Involvement of Consenting Adults is NOT Exploitation
Public Statement by Chuck Vose:

What you read was old literature. Times change and our literature changes with us. Those instructions were from a text I wrote over 200 years ago when virgins were plentiful and people were a lot tougher.

When that text was written, getting shot in the shoulder was no big deal, it happened all the time.  Additionally, we have a lot more sluts now and they attract Unicorns even better.

It's a puritanical lie that Unicorns are only drawn to virgins - they actually prefer sluts.

Furthermore, with better technology, greater understanding of the psychic plane and the ability to speak with the spirits at the burial grounds,  we no longer need to shoot the virgin in the shoulder with an arrow.... or at all.  A simple combination of non-violent methods render much more efficient and socially acceptable results.

The excursion planned for November 20th  is purely non-violent. No virgins or sluts will be injured or exploited in any way whatsoever. All of the participants in my expedition are adults. Consenting adults. And I hold that consent is not exploitation.

Regarding the reference to the terrible events of 2005, well I would never kill a unicorn again. It is simply  ... the most terrible thing. There were extenuating circumstances that were not explained at all in what you read.  That was an expedition in Australia and we got in too deep. There was nothing we could have done. If I could have that day to do over again I would, but we all know life is never that simple.

Anyone who doubts my methods or my integrity as a Unicorn Trainer is welcome to join the viewing portion of my expedition to see first hand how I operate.  There really is no better way to understand the majesty of the handsomest of equine nor the purity of my methods.

Finally, anyone who has anything else to say about me, have the courage to say it to my face.
