The Unicorn Guild
@theunicornguild
Motto: Unicornium Intus Vero Corde Credentis
"Unicorns live inside the true believer's heart"

The Unicorn Guild is the most ancient of the guilds. It was established by Royal Charter granted by King Charles 1 in 1631 and is one of the Great Twelve Guilds with a long history closely connected to the development of the City of Portland. The Guild funds its activities from income derived from its investments arising from this and in the 21st Century, the guild plays a major role in the provision of support to unicorn education and is a vibrant participant in new educational initiatives.

The Unicorn Guild is also custodian of an archive stretching back to its earliest days as well as historic buildings, art and other artifacts. As well as maintaining this collection, the Guild keeps its history alive by continuing its own traditions and, as the premier Guild, fully participating in the civic life of the City of Portland.

The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers

The Clockmakers’ Company was established by Royal Charter granted by King Charles 1 in 1631. It ranks 61st in the order of precedence of the 110 City of London Livery Companies. It is the oldest surviving horological institution in the world, and its motto is Tempus Rerum Imperator, Latin for Time is the ruler of (all) things. See our History & Customs.

The Worshipful Company of Saddlers is one of the very oldest of the City of London Livery companies. The earliest surviving records of a Guild of Saddlers in London date from circa 1160 AD, although the guild could well pre-date that.


Welcome to The Haberdashers' Company
The Haberdashers' Company is one of the Great Twelve Livery Companies and has a long history closely connected to the development of the City of London. Arising from this and in the 21st Century the Company plays a major role in the provision of support to education and is a vibrant participant in new educational initiatives. Alongside this remains a continuing commitment to charitable work that continues to play an important part in the work of the Company.


The Worshipful Company of Weavers is the most ancient of the Livery Companies in the City of London. It existed in the year 1130, and was perhaps formed earlier. The Company received a Royal Charter in 1180. At present, the Company retains a connection to textiles through its contributions to the textile industry. It has, however, like most other Livery Companies, evolved into a charitable institution rather than remaining a trade association.


The Mercers' Company

The Mercers’ Company is the Premier Livery Company of the City of London. The Company, and its associated charitable trusts, makes substantial grants to support education, general welfare, church and faith and arts and heritage. A network of almshouses and other homes for the elderly are also managed by the charitable trusts associated with the Company. The Company is closely involved with the running of 17 schools across the country and supports them primarily through the appointment of governors.

The Company funds its activities from income derived from its investments, mainly property in London’s West End and the City.

The Company is also patron of a number of benefices in the Church of England (i.e. it has the right to appoint the vicar or rector of a parish) and maintains close links with its affiliated units in the United Kingdom’s Armed Services.

The Company is custodian of an archive stretching back to its earliest days as well as historic buildings, art and other artefacts. As well as maintaining this collection, the Company keeps its history alive by continuing its own traditions and, as premier Livery Company, fully participating in the civic life of the City of London.
