Chuck
You heard from an intern at your office that her sister’s mother in law went to an astrologer (the blonde one, you are pretty sure) who told her she was going on an expedition to find Unicorns and she told her friend who was overheard by your intern that her astrologer was seen by the mother-in-law’s cousin conversing with Gnomes who, as everyone knows, can see Unicorns and usually knows where they are, if only to be able to keep them out of their gardens. Given this information, you wonder what the astrologer knows but you decide not to ask her outright because you don’t want to look like you aren’t totally in charge of things here. Also, you think Gnomes are annoying because they aren’t all that nice to Unicorns. Vaguely, you wonder why Gnomes and Unicorns aren’t friends but you have more pressing matters to attend to. For instance, you are using this expedition to scope people out for a new apprenticeship. You want to be subtle about it - Unicorn Association Apprentice selection is always shrouded in mystery and you want to keep up appearances for them. 
Devin
You smelled Cotton Candy along the water front and thought there was a huge festival and got really excited. You ran to the water, but when you got there, there wasn’t anything but a big flock of birds and a bunch of squirrels. You have no idea why there were so many birds and squirrels around but it WAS hilarious. You decide to tell this as a really funny story and don’t really think it means anything - even if others try to convince you that is does.
Cam
You were following a trail along a city street and ran into a sigh post. Just as you went down, you could have sworn you saw a Unicorn get on the Street Car. You later woke up in the hut of a Selkie in her human form who didn’t really want to hear about Unicorns just then, she was much more interested in (...ahem...) tending your wounds. Anyway, you are starting to doubt the memory now (the selkie was very distracting) and are hesitant to bring it up as you are somewhat embarrassed by the whole running into a post thing.  Additionally, you heard that the ghost hunter was out measuring things before the expedition started and you think she might have some info... maybe some insight. You decide to find out if she did go out exploring before everyone else and if she learned anything interesting. You decide to be casual about it and start by asking her about all her gadgets which she very clearly loves. 
Tyler
You have been an urban tracker for a long time now and you are ready for a change. You would like to get an apprenticeship in the in the Unicorn Trainers Association but you need a sponsor. You want to apprentice under Chuck and you plan to use this expedition to prove yourself to Chuck. You need to prove to him that you are more eager, more enthusiastic, more skillful and more engaged than everyone else.  If all else fails, try to get Chuck alone to talk to him about the flash of white you saw on the bridge over the highway and use that to impress him and persuade him to offer you an apprenticeship.  You know that the Unicorn Trainers Association has a magical selection process that is known for its elusive and exclusive aura of mystery and surprise. You have also heard the rumor that UTA not only prefers to use their own selection process but they actively refuse people who ask to join as they see this as undermining their selection process and their exclusive mysteriousness. You need Chuck to suggest an apprenticeship himself.    
Clara
You have a really great relationship with Gnomes as they are natural gardeners. Plus you love their brightly colored row houses and gorgeous gardens. You stopped by to chat with a friend of yours in the Pearl District and he was telling you all about his harvest when his old mother rambled by and muttered something in Gnomish. Fortunately you speak you speak a little Gnomish and you caught the phrase “Common garden pest … something … something … Unicorns.”  You asked your friend about it but he was strangely quiet and quickly changed the subject. You don’t want to brag or make others feel intimidated by you (you speak Gnomish for heavens sake! It’s the most complex language in existence!) So you hedge and try to find out what other people know about gnomes and their relationship to Unicorns. You really just want to know why your friend wouldn’t talk about Unicorns with you. You decide to ask around as casually as possible to find out what other people know about Gnomes. You don’t really want to reveal what you heard or that you know any Gnomes, but if pressed, you won’t lie.  Additionally, you heard that the engineer had a dream about Unicorns and you are a teensy bit offended that he didn’t go to you to ask for an interpretation - you ARE an astrologer after all! You decide to casually mentions dreams and try to get him to tell you his dream so you can interpret it for him at great length. (only if he shares though - you don’t want to push him). 
Raelynn
Secretly you believe that Virgins are much better as Unicorn bait and you are very nervous that the expedition will fail without one. You  know of a virgin on Glisan St., in fact a whole lot of virgins live there. They are of legal age for Unicorn hunts and everything! When you talk of your friends, you refer to thier house as The Collective. You know that they are virgins but they are also not too prudish, so you think they would probably fit in pretty well.   So you try to persuade Chuck and others that really, Virgins are better for luring Unicorns. This is really only based on your own past experience though so you are only half certain and second guess yourself as you try to persuade people that the group needs a virgin. *If the group does go for it, “call” your friends and tell the group that at least ten girls are on the way. (You neglect to mention that they are super flaky) cover for the girls taking a long time to find the group by describing them in great detail. (ie. how pure and sweet they are with long flowing locks and huge bright eyes etc..)  You notice that Genevieve has a bit of something in her aura that suggests she has been canoodling with mythical creatures and you area bit concerned … you heard there was a siren seducing people and stealing from them in the NW district and you are a little worried for her. You decide to broach the subject delicately by talking about all the kinds of mythical creatures humans have been seduced by in the past. 
Scott
You saw unusually large clusters of birds and squirrels on main near the parkblocks. They were swarming around the giant stag and for a second when you looked, you could have sworn you saw the stag turn it’s head and look right at you. As you stood there, shocked by what you saw, you almost got run over by traffic and a biker yelled at you so you were all flustered and somehow in the process got in the way of the woodland creatures who were also trying to get out of traffic. Then, with out warning, the whole scene resolved back to normal and the animals and traffic were like any other corner in downtown Portland. Strangely, you noticed Gnomes walking away from where you stood just before they disappeared around the corner and realized they had probably righted the scene with their magic. Strange because you know Gnomes stay generally out of Unicorn business and anything related to Unicorns, including the woodland creature swarms they tend to induce. (unless the Unicorns are in the Gnomes’ gardens and then all hell breaks loose.) The reason for this it that Gnomes regard Unicorns as annoyingly vapid, sparkly pests – all bubbly, happy and WAY too “Disney Princess” for their taste. Gnomes much prefer a good poetry slam, lyrical dance or a good Russian novel to frolicking in the meadows. Gnomes also regard themselves as totally superior to most other sentient beings, including humans but few people know this as they are exceptionally polite and will never utter a controversial word if they can avoid it.  Also, you notice Tyler bugging Chuck for an apprenticeship but you know that everyone knows that the Unicorn Association (UTA) never picks people if they ask for it - you decide to tease him a bit about it to let him know you know what he’s up to. You respect the mysterious selection process enough to not actually say the word apprentice though - you don’t want to loose the guy his chance or anything - just give him a hard time. 
Annie
You were out last night taking readings and doing some preliminary recordings in old town when you were mugged by Dwarfs who took all your recordings. You are a little hesitant to share what you were up to as you aren’t totally sure the group will be ok with you going out ahead of everyone to look for Unicorns ... really, you’re allowed to walk around down town if you feel like it! ...right?  ...but, the others might not see it being so innocent. Not to mention, you lost ALL your work! Which is totally embarrassing to you. You have absolutely nothing to show for you work except the vague clip-clopping hoof noise you heard off in the distance in Old Town. If people ask you anything that might lead you to talk about this, you try to deflect by engaging people in a discussion about how Trolls suck because there was this “one time” when you got mugged in Old town and had all your recordings stolen and wouldn’t it be weird if the Unicorns were in Old town somewhere?.  You also have reason to believe something happened with Scott yesterday because he was being really jumpy and talking about Gnomes a lot. Not that talking about Gnomes is weird really, he just usually doesn’t talk about Gnomes and Unicorns relations with so much concern and interest.
Dylan
You had a dream about Unicorns in a park with a single enormous tree. As an engineer, you usually disregard dreams as nothing more than your subconscious babbling when it’s unsupervised by you conscious brain but this dream was very vivid... it was almost like a memory more than a dream. You simply don’t know what to make of it and so you try to put it out of your mind. Unlike normal dreams however, you can’t seem to get it out of your head. It almost has a life of it’s own and come into you brain unbidden.  You also notice that Raelynn is strangely obsessed with virgins and decide to find out if she is lying about not being a virgin. You don’t want to put her on the spot or make her uncomfortable so you decide to go about it by talking to her about her virgin “friends” assuming that she is actually talking about herself.
Mike
A squirrel stopped you the other day to tell you about the overcrowding in his tree for the past few weeks. His tree is one of the places that Unicorns like to gather. With all the hype, lots more Unicorns are coming into town to watch the expedition which in turn attracts a lot more birds and squirrels which has caused a major food shortage.  The squirrel wanted you to know that all the Unicorns are planning to tag along in the expedition and follow behind everyone to see what happens – which the squirrel thought was hilarious. You decide not to share this with the group as you don’t want to out your squirrel friend and you know that telling them would just make people feel silly and awkward.  Not to mention the Unicorns would leave if they knew that the expedition crew knew they were following behind.    However, if everyone continues to hunt for the Unicorns they may relent and show themselves for a while.  You do however, as part of the expedition crew, feel slightly responsible and bad for the squirrels so you try to feed all the city animals you can find as you walk along.  You also try as hard as you can to not look over your shoulder while you walk, but it’s hard! If the group gets too accusatory about who knows where Unicorns are or who is or is not sharing all they know. You casually hint that the Unicorns “probably already know we’re looking for them.”  And  “Unicorns probably are watching us right now deciding whether to show themselves or not.” And “We should be really nice to each other so the Unicorns will think, I mean know, we are nice.”
Heather
 You saw glitter trails on Broadway while you were out walking and you think it may have been Unicorn trails. You know that Chuck knows all about these things so you decide to ask him all about the Sparkle vision and the Sparkle vision potion... maybe you have the Gift too! Do everything you can to get Chuck to give you a sample of the Sparkle vision potion.  You don’t think to bring it up until people start talking about gnomes but it turnsout that you happen to know something so one else does, Unicorns LOVE that they annoy Gnomes. You don’t know why Gnomes get annoyed by Unicorns but whatever it is, Unicorns always seem to ham it up around Gnomes and they giggle hysterically when the Gnomes get all grumpy and mutter-y.

The Hunt Begins
Elderly Unicorns, Glitter Bombs, & Getting to the starting point
Clue # 1    
*All It’s not far at all as the bumble bee flies. Such is the greatness of the engineer, he has built a Better Bee to show you the places where Unicorns fly. But how much do you trust him? Enough to be eaten? (Play Track One)  Dylan * Guide your group to your Better Bee. Will they trust you enough to be eaten alive by your own creation?  Seek Unicorns in the mist as you ride in the belly of the mechanical bee.  Clue #2
*All The Bee spits you out. You are not to his liking - not nearly as tasty as the queen. Nevertheless, it has taken you as far as it may. Look to your right. The Street Crawling Caterpillar in Green, Orange or Red often passes by here. (Play Track Two & Watch You tube) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v18dTTodM0&feature=youtube_gdata_player 
Mike * Animal Whisperer, your skills are needed! Summon, if you can the Caterpillar of the Streets. This is a ride you will take to The End and two blocks Beyond.
The Coffee Shop & the Celebrity Sighting

3.     *All Your next test is Courage. Dare you eat the food of Unicorns? You are headed to the sacred dining place known to Unicorns as “Sun Set.”  You may be confused. Humans do not know the place by this name - they have always pronounced it without the “T”. (Play Track Three)  4.     *Chuck Head to the Trader. He who can sell you your most favorite Unicorn Trainer Snacks. You will need sustenance for your journey. Buy yourself some small red and Oh, So Delicious snacks to share. (Play Track Four)
5.     *All You’re off to the City of Books! The Great Library of Unicorn Wisdom, which rivals the great libraries of Alexandria.  Check with your animal whisperer to know if you need to make an offering of peace and gratitude to the Street Crawling Caterpillar. If the weather be terrible and too cold and rainy, you will know that the creature is most displeased and you need to return to it to travel to your next destination.  If the creature be sufficiently appeased and the weather is not too bad, walk ten blocks into the East.  Past the rounded domes of the Unicorn Temple. Past the International Unicorn Trainer’s Association Hostel. Past the rainbow houses where dwell the little people and over the bridge which marks the boundary of the Ancient Unicorn Burial Grounds. Turn Southward when you reach the Orange Line of that Street Crawling Caterpillar. (Play Track Five)  Mike * If people are tired or cold or grumpy or if the weather turns bad - back-track two blocks and ride the "Street Caterpillar" back to your next destination - it stops right at the corner you need. (See envelope #5 if you need clarification)  6.     *All Find your way to the Room of Red.  The Color of Passion.  Clara, Raelynne & Heather * Here is the challenge for Unicorn Bait. With the help of your party you will demonstrate with posing and zucchinis your ability to lure and seduce Unicorns. You will find the tools you need in the Second Section of Row 868. Look to the bottom shelf and select a tome and page. Unicorn Bait, you will need to take charge and organize this crew and Zucchini in the correct positions. (Play Track Six)  7.     *All Continue East past the Indian elephants, one atop the other, they are pointing out your way.  You are headed to the Secret Gardens of the Great Sleeping Dragon. There beyond the Guardian Gate is the place you seek. Walk past the yellow sign of the Magic Garden - this is but a mirage and a distraction from the true garden you seek. Turn past the sign of the Golden Pegasus, you are nearly there. (Play Track Seven on your way)  Scott & Annie * You must meditate and commune with the spirits. Ghost Whisperer and Hunter now is your Test. Sense the vibrations and lead a meditation for your Expedition Crew mates. Be sure to help them lest they interrupt the vibrations and hinder your communications with the Unicorn Spirit world. (Play Track Eight when you arrive) 
The food fiasco

8.     *All The secret and ancient underground catacombs are your next destination. An oasis marks the entrance, you will know it by its Italian repast and barley malted succor. Rest here a while.  (Play Track Nine)  Chuck, Tyler & Cam* Urban trackers will lead. Between 2nd and 3rd on Davis is where you are bound.  Take what opportunity you may.  The others will stand guard, while you attempt to infiltrate the depths of the Secret and Ancient Catacombs.  Chuck* When you arrive, open the envelope marked “do not open yet” and use what you find
Why Maps are a good idea

9.    *All Head to the Burning Side and turn South on the Broadest of Ways. Walk ever Southward to the Place of the Pioneers.  When you see The Sign in green and white with the name of the first mate of that crazed Captain Ahab, you have arrived. To the back of this sign is the Unicorn Calling Circle. Stand in the center and make The Unicorn Call. This will only work if each member of the expedition makes the call while the others blow the magical bubbles that will lure Unicorns to you. The Greatest of all Unicorn Trainers, Chuck Vose knows the call and can teach everyone. (Play Track Ten)  10.*All The Sign! Seek Ye the Sign! Astrologers will know The Sign.  It tells of Timbuktu and Casa Blanca. You will journey hence to the waters edge. Look! All the animals and woodland creatures are gathering; a sign that Unicorns are near.  Once you reach the last street at water’s edge, turn southward again to the Tailor’s Row. (Play Track Eleven)  Alden & Gizzelle (or Chuck if need be)* The entire world is contained in a single tiny grain of sand. Imagine what could be contained in the world’s tiniest park.
The accidental park performance
  11.*All Can you feel it? Unicorns are close at hand. The air freshens and sparkles like glitter. Birds sing and bells chime from far off. The smell of cotton candy is in the air. Quickly now to the Sacred Unicorn Grotto.  Walk West to the street that is Thrice Blessed. Then South again to the Street of Clay. Carefully. Stealthily. Keeping the Theater to your back lest you meet greatest peril. Approach the edge of the park and see what you may. (Play Track Twelve)
