Cameron Elliott Master Urban Tracker and Secret Agent

We caught up with Cameron Elliot undercover in Argentina where he shared with us a bit about being an Urban Tracker.  There have only been two other Master Urban Trackers in this Century and none of them have been under 30 except Mr. Cameron Elliot himself. 

Mr. Elliot specializes in the hidden and secret places. His gift for exploration is lauded by his peers, regarded with exasperation and annoyance by the authorities in various countries from which he has been banned and showered with admiration and fascination by young would be adventurers everywhere.

His success is in part due to his unique genetic inheritance that he refers to as sparkle vision. Not to be confused with sparkle motion. He is the 4 grandson of the renowned Dr. Eli E. Elliot, and the first descendant in this line to carry the same gene that allows him to see the paths where Unicorns have tread.  He describes it as looking like a slight milky film mixed with sparkles. 

He is also the creator of the patented Sparkle Vision Potion #9. Sparkle Vision Portion #9 comes in both lotion and spray formulas and can be applies to any eye-wear to enhances his own ability to fully see the Unicorn Trails. It works for others without his special genetic makeup to a less dramatic effect. When applied to the eyes or any eye-wear, "Normals" as he calls them can see bits of glitter on the sidewalk and lamp posts where Unicorns have walked. 

Cameron Elliot is a long time friend of Chuck Vose and has worked with him on Unicorn Adventures many times in the past. Elliot was, in fact the one who pulled Chuck Vose out of the rubble after the tragedy of 2005. Chuck Vose has been quoted saying, "Its really all because of Cam that I got into the Unicorn business in the first place. I couldn't have done it with out him."

Professor Dylan Wilder-Tack, World Famous Tiny Unicorn Bridge Engineer

Professor Dylan Wilder-Tack, World Famous Unicorn Bridge Engineer, who usually declines interviews, spoke with us today in an exclusive interview.
The Professor shared with us;

I began my career as a tiny bridge engineer in the court of the Fairy Queen where I built tiny mechanical flying mice for her majesty.  Those were glorious days filled with magic and shiny glittering whiskers. The mechanical mice I constructed were a precise and exacting design of my own on which her majesty's bountiful self could mount and soar above her subjects. 

I first met Chuck Vose at a conference on magical construction of bumblebees, which as we know defies the laws of aerodynamics, which presented the perfect challenge to the magnificent and dazzling intellect of Mr. Vose and myself. Together we believed we could build a better bee. Alas shortly after the conference, the Queen was gobbled up by her flying mouse and I was cast out of the Court of the Fairies in disgrace. Apparently, they didn't appreciate my gastrointestinal accuracy.

As it turns out, Chuck had great need for a tiny feats of engineering and set me to work immediately upon the design of tiny bridges for unicorns. I began with tiny replicas of The Golden Gate Bridge and the Galloping Gurdie*.  Alas, my designs were stolen by a weasel-faced underling of the Queen, Andrew Lloyd Wright, and made into monstrous atrocities. I continued my endeavor undaunted, trying to construct the perfect tiny unicorn bridge, which I believe I shall succeed at this November 20th.

Incidentally, you may be wondering why unicorns need tiny bridges.  The answer is quite simple; unicorns stomp these bridges in defiance of their lost brothers.  The tale that we now know as The Billy Goat's Gruff is a crude interpretation of The Tale of the Unicorn Brothers, who were tragically subverted by the evil Bridge Troll.  This stomp is a strike for all of unicornkind.

Unicorn Quarterly feel fortunate to have spoken with the elusive and dazzling Professor Wilder-Tack whose harrowing work with tiny engineering will surely contribute to the success of the Unicorn Expedition this November 20th.

Raelynn Keron, World Famous Astrologer

In an exclusive interview with Raelynn Keron today, we learned more about the amazing cast Chuck Vose has drawn together and insight into what the Expedition Crew can expect this November 20th.

The omens that precede this Unicorn Expedition are growing and with it, anticipation for this exciting event. Not only that, but Keron brings with her first hand experience with luring Unicorns!

I have indeed signed on as an Astrologer for this much anticipated Unicorn Expedition. Though I had expected this event and my participation in it for some time, I am no less honored to be involved. I have not had the pleasure of working with the honorable Chuck Vose in the past, nor have we met. Yet I feel as though I already know him.

I have followed his work closely for several years, since I realized this event would occur. I have even had dreams about this day since my initial prediction. The dreams have grown stronger and clearer as the day has approached. This has never occurred with any prediction in the past, which should tell your readers just how unprecedented this event is. I cannot elaborate on these dreams, as that would be extremely unprofessional, but I can say that unicorns, sluts, and a zucchini were involved.

I would say my prediction of the event and the accompanying dreams are the most important qualifications for participation in this event. In addition I am well renowned in my field for the accuracy of my predictions. My fans should know that one additional qualification I have for this expedition is that I was involved in a unicorn expedition long ago, when I was quite young, with a much less experienced Unicorn trainer who will remain unnamed. However, in that expedition I was the virgin. I have the scar as a constant reminder of that fateful day, my first and only unicorn sighting.

I believe that experience is the reason I was able to predict this expedition so accurately. I feel certain that we will be successful in our endeavor considering the favorable planetary alignment, especially Venus in relation to Uranus. In addition, the skilled Mr. Vose has created a team of professionals that will take full advantage of the favorable astrological conditions. I can't wait to see what this amazing team can do! This day is sure to go down in history.

There you have it folks! Though we are left wondering where exactly this scar is! In our interview Ms. Keron declined to say where. We do now know that the planets are aligning and indications all point to fantastic success this November 20th. Unicorns will be seen.

World Famous Unicorn Astrologer and Unicorn Astrology Camp Director, Clara Householder

Clara Householder, world famous astrologer shared some of her universal wisdom with us today. 

Ms. Householder, a sexy and decidedly alluring blond, resides currently in Olympia and very sweetly replied that she was happy tp speak with us and mysteriously referenced a past involving Darwin and Amelia.
Perhaps this is a constellation relating to Unicorns, Astrologers can be vague at times.

Nevertheless, Ms. Householder spoke with us saying,

Honestly, I feel very honored by the opportunity not only to speak with Unicorn Quarterly, but to be apart of this expedition. I understand that there are many Unicorn Astrologists who would love an opportunity such as this! I mean really, how many Unicorn Astrologists can say they've had the opportunity to work with the Chuck Vose?!

As for your questions. My greatest accomplishment in the field of Unicorn Astrology has been aiding in alluring the unicorns. It is said that a unicorn will only show itself when the ruler is just and kind and when times are peaceful and prosperous or when there is a virgin who exposes her breast in the woods. Well, we have found that sluts with zucchinis works just as well, if not better than the former methods for attracting unicorns.

The sluts and zucchinis are not the most important piece, however, Uranus is. It is no coincidence that Uranus plays a major role in determining the approachability of a creature who is often referred to as "an ass with a horn". Without Uranus in it's correct alignment, there would certainly be no unicorn sightings or taming.

My prediction for November 20, 2010? Well, Uranus looks like it just might cooperate with us for the evening. Now we just need the sluts and zucchinis and Chuck knows what to do from there!

I am looking forward to the expedition!

Looking forward to the expedition indeed! Lucky Chuck Vose! It's no wonder he picked Ms. Householder!  What a spectacle is in store for us all this November 20th!

Tyler Sellon, World Famous Adventurer and All Around Renaissance Man

We at the Unicorn Quarterly had the unexpected honor of speaking with Tyler Sellon, the world famous adventurer and all around Renaissance Man. He shared with us a bit about himself and we were awed. This is a man who knows the magical, mythical world of unicorns like no other. He describes himself as a man with moxie, verve, and--most of all--pluck. We agree.
Sellon shared with us,

 "I've hunted kraken in the polar north, bowled with minotaurs, and feasted up on the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary. I once spent seven days trapped in the nest of a thunderbird, my only sustenance the lightning-lice with which it was infested. I have glimpsed the sane Republican. The "rare" and "mythological" are what I live and breathe."

My skills include fletching, filching, and flensing. I can hold my breath for ten minutes, a skill learned while sailing with the mighty pirate, Guybrush Threepwood. I have a preternatural sense of timing, and an uncanny ability to take sole credit for group endeavors. I lead both by example and shouting, adapting as necessary to the situation.

This November 20th, he joins the Chuck Vose Unicorn Expedition for a new adventure of epic proportions. Unicorn Quarterly is your Unicorn Journal for all the latest and most exclusive interviews and information. Join us next week as we speak with more of Chuck Vose's Expedition Crew to learn about the world-class crew Vose has gathered.

Gizzelle Williams, International Pop Star

International Pop Star, Gizzelle Williams is famous for her narrative ballad style Unicorn songs and bright, playfully lyrical adventures.

It is rumored that she lived for four years in a hidden Unicorn Valley, a sort of Shangri La of Unicorns where the amazing and fantastical stories in her songs actually come from. 

While she does not deny these rumors outright, the devastatingly sexy brunette is decidedly evasive when asked if these stories are true. Suspicions are growing that there may be some truth to them however as, in a surprise last-minute twist, Vose asked her to join the Unicorn Expedition. 

Unicorn Quarterly met up with her in a local Gnome Lounge where she sings every fourth Saturday and asked her about her past with Unicorns. she told us,
What is real?  I deal in the business of music and storytelling. All stories are true ... some of them actually happened. The stories about how it seemed and felt are really more true than flat and lifeless facts.

If you want a factual account, you'll have to ask a historian. If you want to know what my life was like, listen to my music. Those are the truest stories I can tell. 

When asked about the role she will play this November 20th, she told us;
I think my musical talents will come in extremely useful. I'm really looking forward to sharing my musical talents with the Portland Unicorns.

Curiosity remains unsatisfied. As ever, Ms Williams leaves us wanting more. We can't wait to see her perform this November 20th!

Mike Lorenzo, Animal Whisperer Extraordinaire

Today, in an exclusive interview with Mike Lorenzo, we were honored to learn of his amazing talent and skill with mythical creatures.

It's hard to believe, after all the amazing individuals we have interviewed on Mr. Vose's crew, that it could possibly get any better, but then it did with this most recent interview. It is a pleasure to share what we learned from Mr. Lorenzo;

I used to think that dragons and unicorns were just myths. At least until I was jumped by some trolls that wanted the contents of my lunch. After that, I found that life had changed considerably. I began to see gryphons, dragons, and ogres all over the place. I later attended Miskatonic University in order to help my understanding of these creatures, though I later found the school lacking in this department. Though I learned much in combating the old ones, I didn't learn anything regarding the magnificent creatures that occupied the world. Dejected, I left the school to see if I could find answers on my own.

It was late one night in my laboratory where I was working on an experiment combining pop-rocks and beer where fate intervened. My experiment literally blew up in my face. When I later woke, I found that the creatures I had been seeking for so long at my bedside. In the accident it seemed that my mixture had caused me to mutate in such a way that I gave off pheromones that attracted creatures of myth to me!

I began to study and catalog every specimen I could find. Though many of these creatures appeared to be fearsome, a little scratching under the chin or behind the ears showed them to be rather gentle and cuddly. It has now become my life's work to enjoy the company of as many creatures as I can find. Standard animals such as cats and dogs proved easy, but taming a seven-headed Liger proved much more difficult.

I am very proud to be able to help the animals with communicating their point of view, offering long distance reiki treatments, essences and offering a Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective.

Scott Vandehey, Internationally Known Ghost Whisperer

Scott Vandehey, Internationally known Ghost Whisperer shared some of his trade secrets with us today in a brief interview.

For thousands of years, Unicorn Spirit has come forward, through a variety of channels, and communicated the wonders and mysteries of life, death, birth, and creation. I refer to such communications as those having passed through the mouths of whisperers such as myself during the last 500 or so years. 250 of which I have spent working with the much respected Mr. Vose as his spirit communicator. 

We go way back, as they say.

I could tell you that being a famous Ghost Whisperer is all about talent, but the truth is, I have worked hard over the past centuries to develop the faith and high vibration needed to begin conscious spirit communication through regular meditation. I have purified my heart and mind to align with higher truths. I have meditated on love, forgiveness, etc., I have faced my own inner demons and thus the communication of spirit vibration has risen in me.

As we know, the power of courage, faith and honor is at the root of legends such as The Sword in the Stone, the Holy Grail, Robocop and The Legend of Neil etc. I, who am brave and pure of heart and mind, have the power to succeed where others fail.  Inner purity is essential, those who succumb to temptations of the ego and thus lower their vibration can end up attracting negative entities.

After a four year meditation on the top of Mount Olive, I feel ready for this expedition and I am looking forward to testing my skill and purity here in Portland, the City of Roses. ... and spirits.  I feel very confident that we will communicate well with the ancient Unicorn Spirits, especially as I am honored by the presence of such a skillful Ghost Hunter as Annie Vandehey.  With her Ghost Tracking skills we cannot fail.

Modest and humble to the last, Scott Vandehey is truly a man pure of spirit, certain to attune to the vibrations of the Unicorn Spirits.  What a treat to speak with him.

=============================================

Annie Vandehey, World Renowned Ghost Hunter

Annie Vandehey, world renowned Ghost Hunter shared with us that she has been hard at work preparing for this expedition. She is a collector of old world curio and a gadget fanatic with a truly impressive collection. She shared a bit about this with us today.

I really, really love my line of work. Honestly it's because of the gadgets! I get to work with so many cool gadgets its kind of insane really! I have about 300 different ones right now, all of my own design and all for the detection and measuring of Ghosts and Spirits.

When investigating a location, I usually start by surveying an area with my special surveying gadgets and then set up electronic equipment in the apparent paranormal hot-spots. I then begin taking electromagnetic field and temperature readings, recording audio for electronic voice phenomena (EVPs), and filming with digital video cameras. Many times I can even verbally coax the ghosts into responding, while recording. Afterwards, I analyze all of the data for signs of possible paranormal activity.

After reviewing the information, I discuss my findings with my Ghost Whisperer partner who can offer suggestions for dealing with any apparent activity, and answer any questions asked of the spirit by channeling their responses through his body.

I think it is important to state here that while I do not believe that every phenomenon captured is evidence of the paranormal, there is much in this world that is cause by the other world. To be certain I am dealing with real paranormal activity, I first  look for reasonable explanations for things such as "cold spots" which may be drafty windows, "strange noises"  which may be a thumping branch or vermin in the walls, "moving objects" which may have been accidentally bumped or tugged and "phantom lights"  may actually be reflections of light from a passing vehicle.

During investigations, I use various equipment, including digital thermometers, EMF meters, thermographic and night vision cameras, hand-held and static digital video cameras, digital audio recorders, and laptop computers.

I have experimented with a Geiger counters, my own custom-made geophone, which detects vibrations and flashes a series of LED's that measure the intensity of the vibration. 

I am really excited to try out my new EMF detector that makes a buzzing sound when in the presence of an electromagnetic field, and the stronger the field, the louder it buzzes. I may also bring my ion generator, a device that charges the air with electricity and theorized to help spirits manifest, and my white noise generator, an audio device that makes a static background noise and theorized to act as a catalyst for assisting entities in making EVPs.

It's going to be a really great expedition! I just have to pick which gadgets I want to bring .... which is limited to what I can carry.

Thank you Ms. Vandehey! We all look forward to seeing what gadgets you bring with you this November 20th!
